# Email Confirmation Setup for Supabase

To ensure email confirmations are working properly, follow these steps in your Supabase project:

## 1. Enable Email Confirmations in Authentication Settings

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Authentication → Settings → Email
4. Make sure "Enable email confirmations" is toggled ON
5. Save changes

## 2. Configure Email Templates (Optional)

While in the Authentication settings:
1. Go to Email Templates
2. Customize the "Confirm signup" template to match your branding
3. Make sure the template has a clear call to action

## 3. Configure SMTP Settings (for Production)

For production environments, configure SMTP:
1. Go to Authentication → Settings → SMTP
2. Enter your SMTP credentials
3. Test the configuration

## Troubleshooting

If email confirmations aren't being sent:

1. Check your browser console for auth errors
2. Verify that your SMTP settings are correct
3. Check the Supabase logs in the Dashboard
4. For development, you can view emails in the Supabase Dashboard under Authentication → Users

If you've enabled email confirmations but want to bypass them for testing:
1. Go to Authentication → Settings → Email
2. Temporarily disable "Enable email confirmations"
3. Remember to re-enable for production
